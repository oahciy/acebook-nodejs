Project retrospectives

During a team project, your team may find it useful to have retrospectives to take time to reflect and talk through how you're working as a team
Process

Time: 30 minutes.

    You assemble as a team.

    One team member writes headings. Some examples are: "successes, struggles" or "liked, learned, longed for".

    For five minutes, you write things under these headings. For ideas on what you might want to write down, see the Questions section below

    If someone has already written something that you felt, put a + next to it.

    The team picks out a few items to discuss.

    The whole team discusses each item.

    As the discussion progresses, the one member of the team notes down important points raised and actions for improvement.

    A member of the team posts photos of the retro on Slack for you to further reflect on and reference in the future.

Questions to consider

    What has gone well?

    What hasn’t gone so well?

    Was everyone’s voice heard in the team? If not, how can we make it better?

    Is everyone up to speed with where we are at? Did we all understand the steps to get here? If not, how can we make it better?

    Does everyone feel happy working in the team? If not, how can we make it better?

    Are we having fun in the team? If not, how can we make it better?

    Did we take regular breaks? If not, how can we make it better?

    What are the next things we want to work on and who wants to work on what?

    By when should these things be coded? What is the most likely reason for this plan not to work and how could we preempt that?

    Have we been helping each other effectively? How can we improve our collaboration?

    How are we following the XP values? Which are blind spots in our team (e.g. the quality of communication)?

    Are we using/experiencing agile development? / What are the links to Agile development in what we’ve been doing?

    If you could change one thing about your experience working as a team so far, what would it be?

    When did we feel most productive and happy so far? How can we use this to impact the rest of our time working as a team?

    What techniques have we found useful so far?

    What has been the most challenging part of the project so far and how did we deal with this as a team? How could we have improved our approach to this challenge?

Why retrospectives?

    They let you reflect on and think of improvements to your learning and developer processes as well as your team processes.
