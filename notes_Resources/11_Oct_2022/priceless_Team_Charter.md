Trello protocol
If a pair is working on it, it has your name on it

If you are the second reviewer and all is ok, accept & merge

During pairings, resolve challenges by:
Debugging and stuck on a 1 hour+ blocker? ask for help!
Need to chat about something? Write on Slack
Need to know the answer now? Directly join a pair with whom you‚Äôd like to discuss an urgent issue.
Cannot move on unless big issue is resolved as a team? Ask scrum master for help

 Stand-Up
